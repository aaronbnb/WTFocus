IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER!

This text file is a *very approximate representation* 
of what this page may be like for screen reader users:

• It lists all the focusable elements (at the point 
  of running the script) but may not include every 
  element. For example, any element that is temporarily 
  set to be non-focusable with `tabindex="-1"`, such as 
  an inactive tab in a group of tab controls, will not 
  be shown here.
• It lists the accessible name and the role 
  (e.g. link, button)
• Where there is an accessible description 
  (provided by `aria-describedby` or a `title` 
  attribute), this is included too
